# HAte-speech-detection

Hate Speech Detection 🛡️
Welcome to the Hate Speech Detection project repository! This project harnesses the power of Python and deep learning techniques for backend development, while Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript create an interactive and engaging frontend.

Features:
Advanced Machine Learning: 🤖 Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models to accurately detect hate speech in text data.
Scalable Backend: 🚀 Python-based backend ensures robustness and scalability for processing large volumes of textual data.
Interactive Frontend: 🎨 A user-friendly interface developed with Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows seamless interaction with the hate speech detection system.
Key Technologies Used:
Python: 🐍 For backend development and implementing deep learning algorithms.
Deep Learning: 🧠 Utilizes neural networks for training and inference, enabling effective hate speech detection.
Node.js: ⚙️ Powers the server-side logic and facilitates seamless communication between the backend and frontend.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: 🌐 Used for building an intuitive and responsive frontend interface for users.
